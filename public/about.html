<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello! My name is Ana and I am studying web development from a course. I am very excited to 
  learn a lot of new things. I am very much so a beginner but I am trying very hard!
</p>

<p>I'm currently a student at FERIT studyinf to be a software engineer. I don't really know what more 
  there is to say about me. I enjoy watching TV shows and movies, baking, spending
  time with my boyfriend and friends and occasionally playing video games.

  I can't wait to learn css so I can make these web pages actually look nice. Anyways, 
  this was a little bit about me. xoxo gg
